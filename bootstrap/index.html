						From as far back as we remember, every meal in our family ended with a steeping cup of tsaa. After meals it was to aid digestion, when we were sick it was to cleanse impurities, when we over indulged it was to keep us slim; at weddings it was to mark ceremony, and on Sunday afternoons it was a reason to gather with family and friends.
					</p>
					<p>
						Tsaa was always carefully prepared. From the purity and temperature of the water to the careful measurement, steep times and serving method.
						We learned that in order to experience its optimum splendor, each tea required a measured balance of all these factors. This is the art of tsaa as we know it.
					</p>
					<p>
						And as time moves forward and the responsibility of introducing tsaa to the next generation lay in our hands, we've come to recognize that there are few tea drinkers who really understand the art of tsaa. We hope to change this by sharing our appreciation for tsaa as it was passed down from our ancestors.
